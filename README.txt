Hello There,
This is my first shared C project.
This is a game of snakes and ladders 
in which the player choose the size of the board
and get to place the snakes and ladders himself.
It means to make the game more interactive and complex.
I would appreciate any contribution especially any pointer improvements and optimization.
Hope you enjoy playing it.
